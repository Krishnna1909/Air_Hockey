**🏒 Air Hockey Game - Hand Gesture Controlled**

An interactive Air Hockey game built with Python and OpenCV that lets you control the paddle using real-time hand gestures. No keyboard or mouse required – just your webcam and your hand!

** 🚀 Features**
- **Hand Gesture Control:** Control the paddle with real-time hand tracking using centroid detection.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Custom ball physics, paddle movement, and collision detection for smooth gameplay.
- **Real-time Scoring:** Automatic score updates after every goal.
- **Modular Design:** Built with Object-Oriented Programming for easy maintenance and scalability.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
- Python
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**📸 How It Works**
1. **Hand Detection:** The webcam captures frames, and OpenCV processes them to detect your hand.
2. **Paddle Movement:** The centroid of your hand is calculated to control the paddle's position.
3. **Gameplay Logic:** Real-time ball movement, collision detection, and score updates.

**🔧 Installation**
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnna1909/air-hockey-game.git
